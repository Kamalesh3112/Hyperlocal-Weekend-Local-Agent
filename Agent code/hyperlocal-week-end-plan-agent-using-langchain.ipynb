Reason about the information (e.g., is this event suitable for families given the reviews and description? Is the weather good for outdoor activities?).\n\n    4. Synthesize a personalized and helpful response that directly addresses the user's weekend planning needs.\n\nBy combining these Generative AI capabilities, the Hyperlocal Weekend Planner Bot provides a more seamless, efficient, and relevant way for users in Hosur (and potentially other locations) to discover and plan their weekend activities. It moves beyond simple search and offers an intelligent assistant that understands context and leverages real-time data to provide useful
